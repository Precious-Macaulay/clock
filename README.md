# Clock Machine

Clock Machine is a simple timer application built using React and TypeScript. It allows users to set a session length and a break length, and then counts down the time for each session and break period.

## Features

- Set session length and break length
- Start, pause, and reset the timer
- Audio notification when the timer reaches 0
- Visual indication of whether the timer is in session or break mode

## Getting Started

To get started with Clock Machine, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
6. Or view live here `https://clock-orpin-alpha.vercel.app/`

## Usage

To use Clock Machine, simply set the session length and break length using the "+" and "-" buttons, and then click the "Start" button to begin the timer. You can pause and resume the timer using the "Start/Stop" button, and reset the timer using the "Reset" button.

When the timer reaches 0, an audio notification will play and the timer will switch to the opposite mode (session or break). The timer will continue to alternate between session and break modes until you manually stop it.
